"""The forward map's plasma support: one read and one booking per step.

A step contracts the booked source moments with the dense jet rows once, solves
the axis and X-points in the bounded warm-started row window
(``fixed_points.solve``), reads the connected membership of the resulting
nodal Bell field at those points (``topology.read_at_stationary_points``) and
books current moments on it (``current.book``). Nothing else reads support:
the legacy spline-clip support and fixed-design read are not reachable from
this route.

All numerical operands are runtime pytree leaves, so one compiled program
serves any state of the same layout.
